# BCC-Team7

This is a university project in the framework of the Blockchain challenge. 

So far, it has been tried to implement a program to create NFTs. 

The first folder shows the NFT contract 
The NFT contract is broken down into 5 sub-contracts, in order to have a better visibility. 

1. AXNFT
This is the main contract, the one to be deployed to make all the contracts work 
The mint function is programmed to add metadata in each token
There is also a function to see the metadata depending on the token id
A function to burn tokens is also implemented

2. Connector 
This is the contract that links all the sub-contracts together. This is for ease of use

3. Metadata
The basic information needed to deploy the NFT contract is stored here. 

4. ERC721
This contract implements the function to mine tokens but also all necessary standard functions of the ERC-721. 

5. Enumerable
This contract keeps track of all the NFTs, so we can know what all the supply is, who has which token, etc... 

Then there is a second folder in which is the Basket Contract
