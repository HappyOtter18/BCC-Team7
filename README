# BCC-Team7

This is a university project in the framework of the Blockchain challenge. 

So far, it has been tried to implement a program to create NFTs and then to put similar ones into baskets . 

The first folder to look at, NFT721, shows the NFT contract 

The final contract is called "SMART_CONTRACT_AXNFT". This contract use the OpenZeppelin Standard. It avoids error and respect the standard as it should be. 

However, before only taking the standard and implement it as such, it was tried to understand it. The NFT smart contract was then deployed from scratch. 

The NFT contract is broken down into 5 sub-contracts, in order to have a better visibility. 

1. AXNFT
This is the main contract, the one to be deployed to make all the contracts work 
The mint function is programmed to add metadata in each token
There is also a function to see the metadata depending on the token id
A function to burn tokens is also implemented

2. Connector 
This is the contract that links all the sub-contracts together. This is for ease of use

3. Metadata
The basic information needed to deploy the NFT contract is stored here. 

4. ERC721
This contract implements the function to mint tokens but also all necessary standard functions of the ERC-721. 

5. Enumerable
This contract keeps track of all the NFTs, so we can know what all the supply is, who has which token, etc... 
The is a old and a new version of the enumerable contract. The old version was programmed from scratch, this incurred errors and was not very stable. 
The version "new" use simply the OpenZeppelin standard and the whole was adapted to our code.

Then there is a second folder "Basket and ERC20" in which is the Basket Contract. The baskets group together NFTs of similar characteristics 
and issue ERC20 tokens which are easily exchangeable by their compliance with the standard. 

The contracts to be studied are those starting with "SMART CONTRACT". The other contracts are trials that could not be implemented.
